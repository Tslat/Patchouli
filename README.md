## License Information
Patchouli's original code and assets are licensed under the CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 Unported
license.

To this end, I recognise all of the work the original developers contributed in the creation and maintenance of this mod, most notably:
- Vazkii
- WillieWillus
- ArtemisSystem
- Hubry

This fork focuses primarily on keeping the mod up to date with modern MC versions, and so will differ from the original more and more as time passes.
Changes made to this fork do not reflect any official stances on behalf of the original dev team.
